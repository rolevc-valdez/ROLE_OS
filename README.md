# ROLE OS

ROLE OS turns a ChatGPT conversations export into a structured, searchable
personal knowledge base, and serves it through a read-only API and web
dashboard.

## Repository layout

```

  builder/      # CLI tool: builds the ROLE Knowledge OS + SQLite DB from a ChatGPT export
  dashboard/    # FastAPI app: read-only API + web UI over the generated SQLite database

  scripts/      # Utility and automation scripts
  samples/      # Sample ChatGPT export + generated output for local testing
```

## Quick start

1. **Build the knowledge base** from a ChatGPT export:

   ```bash
   cd builder
   python builder.py "<chatgpt_export.zip>" "<output_dir>" --clean
   ```

   See [`builder/README.md`](builder/README.md) for details.

2. **Serve it** with the dashboard API:

   ```bash
   cd dashboard
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   export ROLE_OS_DB_PATH="<output_dir>/00_SYSTEM/role_os.db"
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

   Then open `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in a browser for the dashboard UI.
   See [`dashboard/README.md`](dashboard/README.md) for endpoint and UI details.

## Status

This repository currently implements a modular knowledge extraction engine
(`builder/extractors/`), a plain data-access API, and a first usable web
dashboard (`dashboard`). No AI/LLM features are implemented yet — every
extractor is rule-based (keyword/regex matching), not model-based.

## Development

Run the full test suite from the repo root:

```bash
pip install -r dashboard/requirements.txt pytest
python -m pytest
```

See [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) for release history.
